the impact as of 
DeepSeek has now erased $2 trillion worth of market cap in US stocks. NVIDIA just lost $500B+ in market cap!

Update: https://lnkd.in/gZuyrXyH 

All because a $6M Chinese AI startup just achieved what Silicon Valley claimed was impossible.ðŸ˜Ž

Hereâ€™s why DeepSeek is rewriting the rules of AI ðŸ§µ:

Chinaâ€™s DeepSeek just built a reasoning AI model that rivals OpenAIâ€™s bestâ€”and did it for 1/1000th of the cost.

OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4: $600M+ training cost
DeepSeek: $6M total

And DeepSeek R1 is open source.

DeepSeek is not just cheaper to buildâ€”itâ€™s also cheaper to run.

OpenAI: $100+ per million tokens
DeepSeek: <$4 per million tokens

This isnâ€™t just a cost differenceâ€”itâ€™s a paradigm shift.
Silicon Valleyâ€™s AI advantage? Itâ€™s evaporating.

Tech investors in panic mode
Global attention shifts to Chinaâ€™s AI dominance. What if we dont need that many GPUs or even electricity to build better Models!ðŸ”¥

DeepSeek R1 is:
27x cheaper than OpenAIâ€™s models
Open source and permissively licensed
A model that fully discloses reasoning steps
This isnâ€™t just competition. As Marc Andreesen said Itâ€™s Sputnik for AI.


The game is changingâ€”and fast.
